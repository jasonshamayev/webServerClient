# webServerClient
A web server and client that allows multithreading. All coded in Python

This server was run using Visual Studio Code and the client was ran by the windows terminal

serverTest.py and clientTest.py are the only files needed to run

The html files open based on my directory, might not work on other computers, will have to look into it.
I included the html file I have set to open.
